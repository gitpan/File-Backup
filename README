File::Backup distribution
_________________________

This packaged has been moth-balled, retired and put out to pasture by
the author.  Its name is "too generic to be useful."

The previous distribution is still available at
http://search.cpan.org/~gene/File-Backup-0.07

Any people (or bots) who would like to resurrect this package and make
it useful, please contact me.

Thank you,
