Changes file for File::Backup

0.04  Mon Sep 15 2003
    - Renamed the compression arg to compress and handled the
      backward compat issue that then sprang forth.
    - Moved creation of the destination filename outside the archive
      condition.
    - Combined the system and existence calls for archival and
      compression.
    - Fixed a semantic bug with timeformat replacing timeregexp.
    - Added a test for no compression backup.

    - Yikes.  The installation process fails tests and leaves
      META.yml behind.  Oops!  Sorry Ken.  : \
    - Croak right away if no archive or compression executable.
    - Make the system call not fork a shell process.
    - Flip on the debug switch in the test suite...

    - Recreated by Module::Husbandry on Gene's local system.
    - Added comprehensive documentation, including a "wishlist" in
      the TODO section.
    - Added generic aliases for the tar and gzip specific parameters.

      executables live.
    - Added all kinds of croaks and conditional execution statements.
    - Added an optional debug parameter flag and mass _debug() calls.
    - Added YMDhms format string to RE and printf conversion functions.

   - Changed the date string format from YYYY-MM-DD-hh:mm:ss to
     YYYY-MM-DD_hh-mm-ss, because the colons seem to cause problems with
     the GNU version of tar.
